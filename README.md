This was written so I could understand how to do basic CRUD operations from a jetpack-compose app in Android using room. 

It helped me understand jetpack compose and kotlin concepts like ViewModels, coroutine scopes, effects and so on much better.


It takes a very simple entity: a Person who has a name and an age and gives you the ability to list, create, update and delete them. These changes are persisted
